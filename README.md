# furry-fortnight- Is a project I started that would create different types of covers for cellphones, and other electronics. These covers are really more of a rain coat for a cellphone and they can be disposable for the everyday consumer, coming in whatever recommended amounts. Then we would upgrade the basic option to more mid grade versions that maybe have designs and a more durable material. The elite models could be where things get really interesting because it could be made for a more rugged type of consumer such as the branches of the military. These would have some type of structural joints to the phone that would allow it to automatically or by the push of a button come forward when it starts to rain and retract when the rain stops. There could be certain aspects of a military version that helps protect our soldiers by providing some form of dimmer or red cover that makes it more difficult for enemies to see. This is the bare bones of the idea but there are an an abundance of features and design tweaks that I would love to set into motion.
